- Setup

  - Ensure `node` is installed on your machine. The steps for this vary by machine and user, but you can get started by:
    - Visiting https://nodejs.org/en/
    - Downloading the LTS version of node
    - Running the node installer package
    - Restarting your terminal
  - Ensure you have installed `yarn` via node. `npm install yarn -g` should do the trick.
  - Install the websites dependencies by running `yarn` in your terminal

- Making Changes

  - Make sure you are on a git branch that is aptly named for the changes you are working on. Something like `fix-issue-that-is-happening` or `feature-cool-new-page`. You can do this via the git command line tool or with the Github app
  - Run the development server with `yarn start` and make changes to the code
  - Commit your changes with a description message and details
  - Push your commit/branch changes to Github

- Applying Changes to the live site

  - Open a pull request (either via github.com or the Github app) to merge your branch with the `master` branch
  - Be as descriptive and succinct as possible withe pull request name and details
  - Discuss and/or await approval on your pull request with the site maintainers
  - Maintainers will hopefully merge your branch to master and your changes will automatically go live!

- Boom you're great!
